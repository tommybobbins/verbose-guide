Bianchi Accountants Website – things that need sorting out.

- [x]	Bianchi accountants logo at the top of the screen is too small – needs to double in size (approx.)

- [x]	Any way we can change the blue colour of the background images – this seems to be a legacy thing from the initial theme

- [x]	Half way down the main page “we help business grow “ there is a blue box that is some sort of button that takes you back to the home page – I want to delete it

- [ ]	Our Services – any way we can have this set as two columns of two? No. Scaling due to mobiles.

- [x]	Our services – any chance we could remove the bullet points from this page and simply have the text from the title page of each? i.e. Individuals – on the home page this should say INDIVIDUALS – we offer tailored support to our clients covering the areas you require – then when you click on the link you go through to the dedicated individuals page with the bullet point list.

- [x]	Any chance of including bullet points to the lists – I can for the life of me work it out? This would be good for each of the four service pages.

- [x]	Bottom part of main page – this is sort of an about section – can we left justify the text and not have it centred?

- [ ]	Text at the bottom (about) on main page is likely to change as it simply replicates whats on the about page. *This is for STB to complete*

- [x]	Footer – any way to remove the ref to www.zerostatic.io I think that’s a legacy thing from the original theme
