            <p>It's night, the garden is quiet save for the creak of snails
	making their way to the Hostas, all is peaceful. But wait! There in
	the undergrowth lurks Old Tom, the fat ginger cat from number 23. He
	prowls through the foilage on the look out for prey to torture and
	discard. He pauses as the urge to defecate pushes to the forefront
	of his needs. A soft patch of ground is ahead, he pads towards it
	making ready to despoil it with his fetid excrement. </p>
            <p>Familiar scene? Well fear no more because the MSP2000 is here!</p>

            <p>You're late! Where's your keys? There they are, rush to the car. Off to work, better call them. Your phone! Turn around, rush back home. Speeding fine and points on the licence. Expensive morning.</p>
            <p>OurSid to the rescue, coming soon...</p>
